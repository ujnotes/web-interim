Who can see, feel, like and dislike, think, and possibly be happy and sad and calm or angry, like us.<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>An inanimate god, that does not have conscience and thus is neither benevolent or malevolent. It just 'is', and it just does what it does.<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t<\/ol>\r\n\t<h3>Personal god<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe personal god, that many humans are inclined to believe in simply because it is 'simple', especially for an average human being, for it is like him.<br>\r\n\t\tHowever following are some of the inconsistencies associated with the existence of a personal god:\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<ul class=\"list-bullet content-list\">\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>If we and everything else require a creator, then who created the creator?<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Where is he? Why does he not show up? Say, on one of the television news conferences?<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>If he is so powerful to have created everything, why does he allow so much suffering?<br>\r\n\t\t\tWould you let one of your children burn and kill your other child? If a normal human being cannot do that then how could a god who is all so powerful and has all the 'love' of the world \"allow\" such horrible things to happen?<br>\r\n\t\t\tAnd before riding out on the escape goat of the theory of \"free will\", do go through the \"<a class=\"content-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WiufsmxiUiU\" target=\"_blank\">Evil god challenge<\/a>\" &ndash; by Stephen Law<br>\r\n\t\t\tIt is simply not justifiable, be it ANY reason; for a all powerful personal god is supposed to be beyond any and all earthly 'reasons' and 'limitations'.<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Why are 'godly' i.e. holy objects like a book of the religion, an idol not discovered outside this planet?<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Effectively, there is no undisputable evidence of a supernatural entity altering the world.<br>\r\n\t\t\tWhile we are still in the process of knowing more, by now we know why diseases happen, why earthquakes happen etc.<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<div>Why the creation of life is scientifically explainable by the theories of 'the Big bang' and 'Evolution' that have empirical physical evidence in support.<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThus, either a personal god simply does not exist and neither ever did or is an 'evil' god.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>\r\n\t\tInanimate god<br>\r\n\t<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe laws of nature dictates this type of 'god'. The observations and the laws inferred by man from those observations makes this type of god increasingly more\r\n\t\tUnless of course new evidence is found.<br>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tJust as different students might assume different names like 'x' and 'y' for the same unknown of the same question, different communities and thus religions in this same manner name their \u2018gods\u2019 differently.<br>\r\n\t\tHinduism, let that be 'Brahman' and Islam, let that be 'Allah'.\r\n\t\tHowever we all face the same challenge. We are together in this quest of finding that same \u2018unknown\u2019.<br>\r\n\t\tTruth is we are all still looking for the same answer.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>Miracles<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tPeople feel the presence of 'god'. It is true that an everything-god (and not a personal god who has a personality, can think, feel etc.) exists everywhere - for we are alive, and it keeps us alive.<br>\r\n\t\tWe breathe, our heart beats, I can type this - and you can read it; it is a miracle, every &ndash; thing is a miracle. But a scientific one! Nothing is extra special but everything is &ndash; extra special.<br>\r\n\t\tUnfortunately humans, generally are limited in their reach and experiences, and are biased. They decide based of how they feel and only later cherry pick the 'reasons' that would justify their decision.<br>\r\n\t\tFor example, in an accident those who die never get an opportunity to assert that the personal god did not save them, but those who survive go on with their tale of the 'special' blessing of their very special &ndash; personal god.<br>\r\n\t\tWhen the fact is that it was just a permutation, chosen by the benign incidents that preceded it, say, like a wet seat.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>The great mistake<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tUnfortunately for most, the essence of 'god' is lost in translation.<br>\r\n\t\tThe problem is, the idea of god is misunderstood as the personification of the inanimate everything-god in to a real human like god.<br>\r\n\t\tWhile \"the personal god\" is in fact only a mental construct, an idea, not meant to be taken literally.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>The true meaning of god<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tLike a football team is made of a bunch of players working together for a common goal, we too can make a 'god' team. And make common goals and individual goals come true.<br>\r\n\t\tIntercontinental flight, international trade, the rule of law - these are all such feats of the human race on a \"one for all\" team.<br>\r\n\t\tIt is extremely important to know that there is no personal god with white beard living up in the skies. Instead it is an idea, an ideological spirit that is made up of souls like you and me.<br>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>And our wishes?<\/h3>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThere is no guarantee that what you wish for and pray for will come true.<br>\r\n\t\tBut you just increase the 'probability' of it happening by 'wishing' it. More so by sharing that wish with others. And the most, by performing actions towards actualizing that wish.<br>\r\n\t\tFor example: The more people in a society begin wishing that corruption be gone, and more people begin writing and speaking about it and then begin executing steps towards achieving it &ndash; the higher the chances of the corruption actually ending.<br>\r\n\t\tBut of course there is no absolute certainty!<br>\r\n\t\t<br>\r\n\t\tRemember - alone we are nothing, together we could be everything. So the best you can do is - do god's WORK, and then do not worry of the results;<br>\r\n\t\tFor god does not need you to succeed but it 'needs' you to try.<br>\r\n\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t&mdash; where 'god' is not someone or thing with a personality, but is only an idea!\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div id='updated-container'>\r\n\t<div id='updated'>\r\n\t\tUpdated:\r\n\t\t<span id='date'>\r\n\t\t\t2024 May 21\t\t<\/span>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class='center' id='content-body-separator'><\/div>\r\n<div id='sub-list' class='center page-list'>\r\n<a\r\n\tclass='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/god\/no_god' data-target='world\/philosophy\/god\/no_god' data-title='No God'>\r\n<img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/god\/no_god\/index.jpg' loading='lazy' alt=\"Navigation - link to world\/philosophy\/god\/no_god\"><div class='item_block_text'><div>No God<\/div><\/div><\/a><\/div>\r\n<div id='fb_components'>\r\n\t<div class=\"fb-comments\"\n  data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/god\"\n  data-numposts=\"50\">\n<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"fb-like\"\n  data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/god\"\n  data-layout=\"button\"\n  data-action=\"like\"\n  data-size=\"small\"\n  data-show-faces=\"false\"\n  data-share=\"true\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\r\n<div id='nav-list' class='center page-list'>\r\n\t<a id='nav-menu-prev'\r\n\t\t\tclass='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/consciousness' data-target='world\/philosophy\/consciousness' data-title=' Consciousness' >\r\n\t\t<img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/consciousness\/index.jpg' loading='lazy' alt='Navigation - previous page tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div class='arrow'>&#x25C4;<\/div><div> Consciousness<\/div><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/a><a id='nav-menu-next'\r\n\t\t\tclass='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/problem' data-target='world\/philosophy\/problem' data-title='Problem' >\r\n\t\t<img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/problem.jpg' loading='lazy' alt='Navigation - next page tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>Problem<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25BA;<\/div><\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/a><a id='nav-menu-up' class='XURL item_block_container ' href='\/world\/philosophy' data-target='world\/philosophy' data-title='Philosophy'>\r\n\t\t<img class='item_block_image ' loading='lazy' src='\/world\/philosophy\/index.jpg ' alt='Navigation - up level tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>Philosophy<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25B2;<\/div><\/div>\r\n\t<\/a> <\/div>\r\n"}
