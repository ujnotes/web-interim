Keen to inflict maximum carnage.<br>\r\n\t\tUnfortunately, this will continue to happen.<br>\r\n\t\tThat\u2019s just how nature works. Nature loves wars - the living fight and the best who survive, live on<br>\r\n\t\tInterestingly we have already reached the pinnacle of this - a war now almost means total annihilation<br>\r\n\t\tNow nature, needs us to not fight but cooperate.<br>\r\n\t\t<br>\r\n\t\tDue to the expanse of knowledge and technology and the consequential equalization of more and more of the population in terms of economy, human rights and education the 'amount of evil' has been and will be forever diminishing.<br>\r\n\t\tBut recalling \"Murphy's Law\": \"Whatever can happen, will\", we need to structure our systems such that the wrongs cannot happen.<br>\r\n\t\tHistory teaches this. Before and during WWII the media was completely controlled by the Nazis and used to mobilize their destructive ideas en masse.<br>\r\n\t\tThus now it is widely understood and thus practiced at least in the modern societies, to never allow a totalitarian control of the media by any one party.<br>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tDarkness does not equal light. Darkness is nothing but just the mere absence of light. And so \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 are not equal.<br>\r\n\t\tNo matter how hard darkness tries its gonna die out in the presence of light.<br>\r\n\t\tBut man is a special kind of fool - even though the knowledge has been found and presented to him he refuses to accept it.<br>\r\n\t\tThis has to do with his 'selfishness'. His reluctance to change his old ways, to put in that 'extra effort'.\r\n\t\tIn fact man is so foolish that he has even been fooled to do both: 'evil and good' against his own personal interests and likings. Like in the exploitations by 'religious leaders' and 'offer peddlers of capitalism'<br>\r\n\t\tThis stupidity of man has in the past and continues to this day - to devastate the world.<br>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSince the system itself comprises of people and the people are dependent on the system, the solution boils down to two inter-dependent factors that need to be addressed simultaneously:\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<ul class=\"list-bullet content-list\">\r\n\t\t<li><div>Improving the system:\r\n\t\t\tPutting in place a strong lawfully humane yet agile system that does not allow evil and gradually gets the world onboard the ship of knowledge, compassion and selflessness.\r\n\t\t<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Improving the people:\r\n\t\t\tSpiritually educating everyone (who can) to care about everyone and be committed towards and even willing to sacrifice for the welfare of the others and the entire planet.\r\n\t\t<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSuch that a 'global brotherhood' be realized, where there is love everywhere.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAs stated earlier, there will always be pathologically insane and evil human beings, but they are not 'problems' per se but issues to be managed that the 'system' should be well prepared to deal with.\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tOn the peoples' level it is needed, that first and foremost the meaning of <a class=\"content-link XURL\" href='\/world\/philosophy\/life' data-target='\/world\/philosophy\/life' data-title='Life'>life<\/a> be understood:\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<ul class=\"list-bullet content-list\">\r\n\t\t<li><div>The value of life, all lives; that what wonderful 'gift' it is<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Our personal existence's significance and insignificance<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Gratefulness for all that is good<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>How we are all connected, by what we share, even our sufferings and <a class=\"content-link XURL\" href='\/world\/philosophy\/life' data-target='\/world\/philosophy\/life' data-title='Life'>life<\/a> and <a class=\"content-link XURL\" href='\/world\/philosophy\/death' data-target='\/world\/philosophy\/death' data-title='Death'>death<\/a><\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>That alone you are nothing, it is with the world, the others, that you have any meaning whatsoever<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>The separation of the conceptual (not physical or supernatural) soul and the body<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>That we could be in any one of those bodies, looking through any of those eyes<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>To not do onto others what we do not want to be done to ourselves<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Our responsibility<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Our power<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>The problem with selfishness<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>Significance of compassion and empathy and that: benevolence, at times even at ones own cost, is the 'right' thing to do<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>That in the service of others, happiness is to be found<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>What is truth and what is not, and how important truth is<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>What god is and is not; Only a symbol and not a personality<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>That we all are equal and alone we are nothing; And only together we might just be able to solve our most endangering problems<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>That we are but only a part of nature; And securing it is one of our highest causes<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<li><div>To progress is one of the fundamental characteristics of nature, and mankind's duty is to accelerate it and not try to regress it<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tPrevious attempts by the many ideologies and theisms have had partial success.<br>\r\n\t\tBut while their is constant improvement, it is also under continuous threat and is impaired by a range of factors: like wars, terrorism, environmental destruction.<br>\r\n\t\tIn the present state of matters, our efforts as a civilization of the conscious beings is far below than what is needed.<br>\r\n\t\tAnd there is a real possibility that we may very well end up, not making through.

Worst of all - we ourselves could end up bring that upon us with the unimaginable destructive power that we now posses.<br>\r\n\t\tWhile there may be many paths that may lead to the pleasant future we so seek, there are many more that will get us nowhere.

And thus, they become the self proclaimed defenders of the idea.<br>\r\n\t\t\tThis invokes a range of associated primitive feelings when the idea is challenged.\r\n\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t<ul class=\"list-bullet content-list\">\r\n\t\t\t<li><div>Ego<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><div>Shame of 'loosing'<\/div><\/li>\r\n\t\t<\/ul>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAdditionally the ideas may be tied to secondary perks and entitlements.<br>\r\n\t\t\tE.g. say a person's right to things or power, stature and dominance may be justified and authorized based on ideas.<br>\r\n\t\t\tThis gets even more intense feelings involved.\r\n\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tWith the acceptance of an ideas correctness, one also has to accept the possibility of having been wrong all this while.<br>\r\n\t\t\tAdditionally accepting new ideas requires an extra effort to be put to change the habits.\r\n\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTogether, these factors make ideas hard to fairly contest and uproot.\r\n\t\t<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h4>How are feelings installed?<\/h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSome are genetic and innate; Like the feeling of 'hunger'<br>\r\n\t\t\tSome are learnt and acquired; Like 'craving of drugs' or 'hatred towards a race'.<br>\r\n\t\t\tThis happens when the reward and penalty system of the brain is wired to the stimuli.<br>\r\n\t\t\tThe wiring can happen by experience or indoctrination of the correlation.\r\n\t\t<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h4>What decides the intensity and thus the priority of a 'feeling'?<\/h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe type and measure of emotions attached, which in turn are based on the cost of that what is at stake.<br>\r\n\t\t\tE.g.
